# Project Cursor Rules

- Use TypeScript for all application code.
- Backend: Fastify + Prisma + PostgreSQL (no raw SQL).
- Frontend: Next.js 15, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
- Follow the API contracts in contracts.md exactly.
- Shared types live in packages/contracts and are reused by apps/api and apps/web.
- Prefer functional, composable modules over large classes.
- All new routes must include basic tests in apps/api/test.
